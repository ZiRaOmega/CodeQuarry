This documentation covers unit tests for the `app` package, focusing on database initialization and setup functions. The tests utilize `sqlmock` to create a mock database environment, allowing the verification of SQL operations without a real database connection.

### Overview

The `app` package includes several functions related to database operations, such as initializing connections and setting up database tables. The unit tests for these functions aim to ensure that SQL commands are executed correctly and handle error conditions appropriately.

### 1. `TestInitDB`

**Purpose**:
Tests the `InitDB` function to ensure it can establish a database connection and correctly handle the connection setup.

**Function Signature**:
```go
func TestInitDB(t *testing.T)
```

**Test Operations**:
- **Mock SQL Connection**: Establishes a mock database connection using `sqlmock.New()`.
- **Set Expectations**: Sets up an expectation for the `Ping` method to be called to validate the database connection.
- **Execute Function**: Calls `InitDB` with a sample DSN (Data Source Name) and checks that it returns a valid database connection object.
- **Verify Expectations**: Ensures all expected database interactions are completed as specified.

**Error Handling**:
Checks for errors during mock setup and verifies that no expectations are left unmet. If the database connection returned is nil, it flags an error.

### 2. `TestSetupDB`

**Purpose**:
Verifies that `SetupDB` correctly executes all SQL statements necessary to set up the database schema.

**Function Signature**:
```go
func TestSetupDB(t *testing.T)
```

**Test Operations**:
- **Mock SQL Connection**: Initializes a mock SQL environment.
- **Mock Table Creation**: Sets expectations for SQL execution corresponding to table creation queries.
- **Execute Function**: Invokes `SetupDB` to perform database setup operations.
- **Verify Expectations**: Ensures all SQL commands are executed as planned, without any leftover expectations.

**Error Handling**:
Monitors for unexpected errors during setup and SQL execution. Errors are logged and cause the test to fail.

### 3. `TestCreateTableUsers`

**Purpose**:
Tests the `createTableUsers` function to ensure it correctly executes the SQL command to create the `users` table.

**Function Signature**:
```go
func TestCreateTableUsers(t *testing.T)
```

**Test Operations**:
- **Mock SQL Connection**: Creates a mock database connection.
- **Set Expectations**: Expects a specific SQL `EXEC` command to create the `users` table.
- **Execute Function**: Calls `createTableUsers` and passes the mock database object.
- **Verify Expectations**: Checks that the SQL command was executed exactly as expected.

**Error Handling**:
Handles potential errors from the SQL execution and the setup process, ensuring the test accurately reflects function performance under normal and error conditions.

### Example Test Invocation

```go
// Example of how to run the tests (not part of actual documentation)
func main() {
    // This would typically be executed by running `go test` in the command line, not from a main function.
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Isolation**: Each test function is isolated to a specific unit of functionality, ensuring that tests are manageable and focused.
- **Mocking**: Utilizing `sqlmock` provides a powerful way to simulate database operations and test database interaction logic without a live database.
- **Error Verification**: Thoroughly checking for errors and unmet expectations ensures that the tests are robust and the functions behave as expected in various scenarios.
