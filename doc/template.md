## Go Templates Overview

Templates in Go provide a powerful way for generating text outputs based on predefined templates and dynamic data. Go supports templates through two primary packages: `text/template` and `html/template`. These packages allow developers to define templates that can then dynamically integrate data at runtime to produce outputs like HTML, emails, or other text formats.

### Packages Overview

- **`text/template`**: This package is designed for generating textual output from a template, where the output does not require any escaping for safety (e.g., generating configuration files, source code).
- **`html/template`**: This package is an extension of `text/template` and provides the same interface and functionality but is specifically designed for generating HTML output. It automatically secures the output by escaping HTML content to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

### Template Parsing and Execution

#### 1. Define a Template

A template is a string or a file containing one or more definitions that can be combined with data to produce a final output. Templates use placeholders, often referred to as "actions," enclosed in `{{` and `}}`.

Example of a simple template:
```go
const tmpl = `Hello, {{.Name}}! Welcome to our service.`
```

#### 2. Parse the Template

Before a template can be used, it must be parsed. Parsing a template involves analyzing the template's syntax and preparing it for execution.

```go
t, err := template.New("welcome").Parse(tmpl)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("parsing: %s", err)
}
```

#### 3. Execute the Template

Executing a template involves applying it to a specified data structure. The template engine replaces actions with the corresponding data from the provided structure.

```go
type User struct {
    Name string
}

data := User{Name: "John Doe"}

if err := t.Execute(os.Stdout, data); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("execution: %s", err)
}
```

### Safety Features

The `html/template` package automatically escapes all inputs when rendering HTML, which ensures that the output is safe to display in user browsers. It prevents common web vulnerabilities such as XSS by ensuring that inputs are not interpreted as executable HTML or JavaScript.

### Best Practices

- **Contextual Escaping**: `html/template` understands HTML context and will escape data based on where it appears within your HTML (e.g., within a script tag or as a URL).
- **Prefer `html/template` for Web Content**: Always use `html/template` for generating HTML content to leverage its auto-escaping capabilities for better security.
- **Reuse Templates**: Parse templates once and execute them multiple times with different data. Parsing is a CPU-intensive operation.
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors from parsing and executing templates, especially when dealing with user-generated content.

### Conclusion

Templates in Go are a flexible and secure way to generate dynamic text and HTML content. Understanding the distinction between `text/template` and `html/template`, as well as following best practices for their use, is crucial for creating secure and efficient applications.


## Package `templatehandler` Documentation

This documentation covers two main functions in the `templatehandler` package, which facilitate the dynamic rendering of HTML templates in a web application: `SendTemplate` and `ParseAndExecuteTemplate`. These functions manage the process of generating full HTML responses based on templates and data models.

### 1. `SendTemplate`

**Function Signature**:
```go
func SendTemplate(template_name string, data interface{}) http.HandlerFunc
```

**Purpose**:
Creates an HTTP handler function that serves HTML content generated from specified templates. This function dynamically renders HTML by combining pre-defined templates with user-provided data.

**Parameters**:
- `template_name string`: The base name of the template file (excluding path and extension) to be rendered.
- `data interface{}`: The data model that will be injected into the template. This can be any type, including complex structs.

**Operations**:
1. **Logging**: Records each incoming request, noting the requested URL path and the client's IP address.
2. **Template Rendering**: Delegates the task of parsing and executing the template to `ParseAndExecuteTemplate`.
3. **Error Handling**: Responds with an HTTP 500 internal server error if template rendering fails.

**Return Value**:
- `http.HandlerFunc`: A handler function suitable for use with HTTP routers that manage endpoints.

### 2. `ParseAndExecuteTemplate`

**Function Signature**:
```go
func ParseAndExecuteTemplate(template_name string, data interface{}, w http.ResponseWriter) error
```

**Purpose**:
Handles the lower-level operations of parsing HTML template files and executing them with provided data, sending the output directly to the HTTP response writer.

**Parameters**:
- `template_name string`: The specific template file name to be used for rendering, appended to a standard set of layout components.
- `data interface{}`: The data object to populate the template, facilitating dynamic content generation.
- `w http.ResponseWriter`: The writer object where the HTML output will be sent.

**Operations**:
1. **Template File Parsing**: Attempts to parse a set of predefined template files including headers, footers, scripts, and the specified content template.
2. **Template Execution**: Executes the parsed template using the provided data model, writing the result directly to the response writer.
3. **Error Management**: Returns any errors encountered during file parsing or template execution, enabling upstream error handling.

**Return Value**:
- `error`: Returns an error object if parsing or execution fails, which should be handled by the caller.

### Example Usage

```go
// Set up a web server and define a route.
http.HandleFunc("/index", SendTemplate("index", nil))
http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
```

### Best Practices

- **Error Handling**: Proper error checking in `SendTemplate` ensures that the server can respond appropriately to template-related issues without crashing or hanging.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By separating the concerns of HTTP handling and template processing, each function remains concise and more maintainable.
- **Scalability**: Using `interface{}` for data models provides flexibility, allowing the same functions to render different parts of the site with varied data structures.

#### `header` Template

```go
{{define "header"}}
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Code Quarry</title>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sweetalert2@11"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
</head>
{{end}}
```
- **Purpose**: Sets up the HTML head section for all pages. Includes metadata, script references (jQuery, SweetAlert2), and a CSS link.
- **Usage**: Included in each HTML page that needs a common header. Provides a consistent title and ensures that styles and scripts are uniformly available across pages.

#### `footer` Template

```go
{{define "footer"}}
<script src="../scripts/animation.js"></script>
<script src="../scripts/errors_obfuscate.js"></script>
<script src="../scripts/websocket.js"></script>
{{end}}
```
- **Purpose**: Defines the closing scripts that should be loaded after the main content of the webpage. This typically includes animations, error handling, and WebSocket interactions.
- **Usage**: Appended to the end of the HTML body to ensure scripts execute after the HTML content is fully loaded.

#### `login` Template

```go
{{define "login"}}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    {{template "header"}}
    <body>
        <!-- Structure for login and registration forms -->
        ...
        {{template "footer"}}
    </body>
</html>
{{end}}
```
- **Structure**: Combines the `header` and `footer` templates around specific content for a user login and registration page.
- **Content**:
  - **Login and Registration Forms**: Provides interactive forms for user authentication and account creation, using POST methods to secure endpoints `/login` and `/register`.
  - **Dynamic Content**: Contains toggles between login and registration views without needing to load new pages, presumably handled by JavaScript not included in the snippet.

### Rendering and Usage

These templates would be parsed and executed by a Go server as follows:

1. **Parsing Templates**: All templates are parsed using `template.ParseFiles()` or `template.ParseGlob()` if they are in separate files or a single file with multiple definitions respectively.
2. **Executing Templates**: Specific templates are executed based on the user's navigation, typically by calling `tmpl.ExecuteTemplate(w, "login", data)` where `data` contains dynamic content passed to templates.
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error checks should be implemented after parsing and executing to ensure that any issues with template rendering are caught and handled gracefully.
